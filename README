File structure
==============
./simpleLQCD
       |
       +------include  -> all header files
       |
       +------modules  -> all source code implementation
       |
       +------main     -> main program, currently just test

Compilation
===========
For choosing a specific compiler, one may first set the environment variable
for example,
    export CC=/usr/bin/gcc (for C) or
    export CXX=/usr/bin/g++ (for C++)

usually one just need to execute the following command to compile,
        
        step1: mkdir build && cd build
        step2: cmake ../
        step3: make

where program will be installed to directory build, leaving the source code
unpolluted, other compiler flags can be found in file CMakeLists.txt.

More about the usuage of cmake can be found online.
